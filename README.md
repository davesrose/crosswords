Examples of crosswords.  I took Matt Wiseley's distribution (credit given in crossword.js), but improved upon it to include more action buttons and to rely on HTML5 cache instead of cookies.  I appended more buttons, which are associated with self.init2, self.init3, self.init4 events.  Data is loaded from puzzle.js (you can use a crossword generator online for figuring the design and look at puzzle.js to see how the grid is laid out).  Since it is loading an external JavaScript file, it's best to run a local server, such as AMP stack.
